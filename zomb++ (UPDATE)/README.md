# ZOMBIES++
If you want to just run the mod, use the precompiled version of the files to save time. If you want to edit Z++, you need to edit the open source files.
## UPDATES
- _zm_powerups.gsc now holds all functions for custom powerups
- _clientids.gsc now holds all other functions for Z++
- Fixed Zombie Blood
- Fixed Zombie Counter
- Optimized Code for Stability
