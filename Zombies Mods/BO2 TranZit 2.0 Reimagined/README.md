As someone who thinks devs should make most mods open source,
I have decompiled & fixed the _clientids.gsc file to be editable and works.
I believe newer devs should be able to learn from releases like this 
instead of gatekeeping call of duty mods.

Make sure to use the rest of the gsc files required for this mod as I only
made one file open source (but it is the main chunk of the mod).
