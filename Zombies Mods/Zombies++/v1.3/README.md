# ZOMBIES++
If you want to just run the mod, use the precompiled version of the files to save time. If you want to change anything about Z++, you need to edit the open source code.
## DIRECTIONS
###### PRECOMPILED
- Take the **maps** folder containing the precompiled files and directories and place it in your **<your_game_folder>/t6r/data** folder
- You can now load Custom Games or a dedicated server to play Z++
###### EDITING SOURCE CODE
- Compile _**_clientids.gsc**_ as _**_clientids.gsc**_ and place it in the directory _**<your_game_folder>/t6r/data/maps/mp/gametypes_zm/_clientids.gsc**_
###### UPDATES V1.3
- _**_clientids.gsc**_ now holds all functions for Z++ as a Plutonium update broke the other files
- Disabled Staminup on MOTD to prevent crashes with the afterlife system
- Disabled Staminup & Deadshot on Die Rise to prevent crashes with Who's Who
