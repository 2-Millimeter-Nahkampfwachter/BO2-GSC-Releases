# ZOMBIES++
If you want to just run the mod, use the precompiled version of the files to save time. If you want to edit Z++, you need to edit the open source files.
## DIRECTIONS
- Compile **_clientids.gsc** as **_clientids.gsc** and place it in the directory **maps/mp/gametpyes_zm/_clientids.gsc**
- Compile **_zm_powerups.gsc** as **_zm_powerups.gsc** and place it in the directory **map/mp/zombies/_zm_powerups.gsc**
## UPDATES
- _zm_powerups.gsc now holds all functions for custom powerups
- _clientids.gsc now holds all other functions for Z++
- Fixed Zombie Blood
- Fixed Zombie Counter
- Optimized Code for Stability
