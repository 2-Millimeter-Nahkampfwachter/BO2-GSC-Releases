# ZOMBIES++
If you want to just run the mod, use the precompiled version of the files to save time. If you want to edit Z++, you need to edit the open source files.
## DIRECTIONS
- Compile _**_clientids.gsc**_ as _**_clientids.gsc**_ and place it in the directory _**maps/mp/gametpyes_zm/_clientids.gsc**_
- Compile _**_zm_powerups.gsc**_ as _**_zm_powerups.gsc**_ and place it in the directory _**map/mp/zombies/_zm_powerups.gsc**_
- Make sure to replace your _**zm_dedicated.cfg**_ file with the one for Z++
## UPDATES
- _**_zm_powerups.gsc**_ now holds all functions for custom powerups
- _**_clientids.gsc**_ now holds all other functions for Z++
- Fixed Zombie Blood
- Fixed Zombie Counter
- Optimized Code for Stability
